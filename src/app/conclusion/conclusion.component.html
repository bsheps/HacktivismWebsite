            <h1><b><i>Conclusions, Thoughts and Opinions</i></b></h1>
            <p><br>Based on the positive and negative points we can say there is a lot of value that hacktivism has provided to our society as a whole. It seems however, that this value comes at a price. Along with the freedom that expressing ideas anonymously provides, it opens the door to serious abuse and provides a platform for serious crimes and terrorism. While there are some hacktivist groups that have a strong sense of morals and a high level of integrity, without more internal policing inside the more unruly activist groups, the general public will have a hard time taking them seriously. For almost every single positive action accomplished under the banner of hactivism and human rights, there are 3-4 instances of cyber crime that is unwarranted, destructive, and downright juvenile. Until this changes it will be difficult to put groups like anonymous in the same arena as the NAACP. Not to say that this is entirely the fault of the groups themselves. Non-virtual protests are regulated and can be participated in legally. The frame work for what a virtual protest can be is not yet in place. When  legislature catches up to technology we might see a shift in hacktivism practices and even see some of what is currently illegal gain protection from a good samaritan umbrella and other parts, like the DDOS attack be considered a legal from of protest.â€‹<br><br>
